<h2>The New iPhone 6 Concept Comes With A 4.8-Inch Display And 3D Camera</h1>
<p>Today we’ve got a new iPhone 6 concept video that dreams of an iPhone with an edge-to-edge 4.8-inch curved display, along with an 8 megapixel 3D camera. We’ve yet to see 3D implementation in smartphones take off, which is probably a good thing.
